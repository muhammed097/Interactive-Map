## Interactive Maps Section

### Description
The interactive maps section of our website allows users to explore the locations of our clients across different countries. Users can hover over a particular country to see its location highlighted on the map. This feature enhances user engagement and provides valuable information about the global reach of our services.

### Implementation
We implemented the interactive maps feature using JavaScript and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Each country on the map is represented as an SVG path element, allowing us to easily manipulate its appearance based on user interaction. We used event listeners to detect when a user hovers over a country and dynamically change its color accordingly.

### Usage
To interact with the interactive maps section:
- Hover over a country: The country's color will change to red, indicating that it's being hovered over.
- Move the cursor away from the country: The country's color will revert to black.
